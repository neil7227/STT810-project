Dataset:
player data from CPBL(baseball) 
  - variables are mainly numerical.
  - 164 players
  - displays performance of CPBL players in 2025
  - we will use the whole dataset, but will drop some variable that can imply by others.
  - the data need to be cleaned. We'll drop some noise data and fix missing values.

To-Do:
  - This project will include data exploration and making a regression model to predict baseball players' performance.
  - Rather than follow a tutorial, we prefer to explore by ourselves. But we'll learn some method from several tutorial and make them fit our project.
  - We won't change the dataset, but we'll try as much model as we can to find the best one. 

Course Topic(will show):
linear model
logistic model
